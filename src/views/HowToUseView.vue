      The simplest way to improve the user experience is to leave your vote!
      Simply hit up the grading button of any timestamp to let other users know
      that this timestamp is super important and fully matches the description.
      Hit the down button if you think that timestamp was wrong and misleading.
      Our algorithm will make this timestamp less relevant and even disappear to
      avoid confusing other users
